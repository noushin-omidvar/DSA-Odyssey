## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a variety of data structures and algorithms problems that I've practiced to enhance my programming skills. Each problem is accompanied by a well-documented solution, and I've aimed to cover a broad range of topics, including:

- Array and String Manipulation
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- ...and more!

Feel free to explore the solutions, study the implementations, and use them as a reference for your own learning journey.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `arrays`: Contains solutions related to array manipulation and algorithms.
- `linked_lists`: Contains solutions related to various linked list problems.
- `stacks_queues`: Contains implementations of stack and queue data structures and related problems.
- `trees_graphs`: Includes tree and graph-related problems and their solutions.
- `sorting_searching`: Contains sorting and searching algorithms.
- `dynamic_programming`: Includes dynamic programming problems and solutions.
- `miscellaneous`: For any other miscellaneous algorithms or data structures.

Each subfolder contains its own set of problems and solutions. Inside each problem's folder, you will find a detailed explanation of the problem, the algorithm used for solving it, and the code implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring and using this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-practice.git`.
2. Navigate to the relevant folder based on the topic you're interested in.
3. Open the specific problem folder you want to explore.
4. Review the problem statement, algorithm description, and code solution.

Feel free to run the code locally, modify the solutions, and use them to further your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
